Our Project idea is of a comic website, one in which you can select, view and rate your favourite comic books.

Ciaran and I came up with ideas on what we might doing our project on, we settling on doing a website based off a comic book store. The site would be allowed to view the details of the comics, the comics would be sorted by genre, categories, etc and have a random comic of the week would appear at the top of the page. The user would be able to subscribe to the website, allowing them to buy the comics. Once the comics are bought they are stored in the user's personal page which shows only comics that they have bought. The most popular comic of the month would also be shown to the user. The user would be allowed to comment and give reviews on comics, along with a rating system. The website would contain contact details. The user would also be able to customize the look of there profile to cater to their personal wants. The user would occasionally be given discount codes for purchases on the website.

This week upon futher discussion we switched from a website to an Ionic Angular application. 
The reason for this decision is due to the lack of clint-server-database relationship in terms of storage. 
We will be asscessing Firebase as a cloud server database option this week and how we can implement it in our ComicLeague app.
We've decided not to have a purchase option for comics as we want to focus on the rating and reviewing aspect of the comics. The subscription to the site will allow access to all comics.

After reviewing some Firebase tutorials (see wiki) we have settled and are ready to commence developing  the apps body . Firebase will allow us to work concurrently on the cloud ,we just have to connect between the app and firebase project. We are thinking of using Angular authentication for our log in so we will be watching some example tutorials (see wiki) for reference.
We intend to have a base design for the logo of the app complete this week. The logo will be designed using GIMP.
